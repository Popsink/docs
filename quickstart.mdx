## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Deployment">
    Decide between [SaaS, BYOC, On-Prem, or Air-Gapped](/features/deployment) deployment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Credentials">
    Have credentials ready for your source and target systems.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Network Access">
    Ensure network connectivity between Popsink and your data sources/targets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect a Source">
    Choose from 20+ source connectors:
    - [PostgreSQL](/connectors/sources/postgres)
    - [MySQL](/connectors/sources/mysql)
    - [Salesforce](/connectors/sources/salesforce)
    - [BigQuery](/connectors/sources/bigquery)
    - [And more...](/connectors/sources/overview)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure a Target">
    Select where your data should go:
    - [BigQuery](/connectors/targets/bigquery)
    - [Snowflake](/connectors/targets/snowflake)
    - [ClickHouse](/connectors/targets/clickhouse)
    - [MongoDB](/connectors/targets/mongodb)
    - [And more...](/connectors/targets/overview)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your Pipeline">
    Connect your source and target to create a data pipeline. Configure any transformations or filters as needed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Streaming">
    Activate your pipeline and watch data flow in real-time!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: PostgreSQL to BigQuery

Here's a quick example of setting up a common pipeline:

<CodeGroup>

```bash PostgreSQL Setup
-- Enable logical replication
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;

-- Create replication user
CREATE USER popsink_user WITH REPLICATION;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO popsink_user;

-- Create publication
CREATE PUBLICATION popsink FOR ALL TABLES;
```

```sql BigQuery Setup
-- Create dataset
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS `your-project.popsink_data`;

-- Grant permissions to service account
GRANT `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` 
ON SCHEMA `your-project.popsink_data` 
TO "serviceAccount:popsink@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com";
```

</CodeGroup>
