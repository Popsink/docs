description: Launch your first Popsink pipeline in minutes with this guided tutorial.

Follow this quickstart guide to create a Popsink pipeline that streams data from a source to a target connector. You will use
the Popsink console, configure alerting, and validate that data flows end-to-end.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in and create a workspace">
    1. Sign in to the [Popsink console](https://console.popsink.com) with your organization account.
    2. Create a new workspace or select an existing one. This workspace hosts the pipelines and credentials you configure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure a source connector">
    1. Open **Connectors → Sources** and click **New Source**.
    2. Select the connector that matches your system. For example, choose **Postgres** to capture database changes.
    3. Provide the required credentials and connection parameters.
    4. Validate the connection and save the source.

    <Callout type="tip">
      Review the connector guides to learn about network prerequisites or advanced settings specific to each technology.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning">
      Ensure you have workspace administrator rights (or equivalent) before creating and validating new connectors.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure a target connector">
    1. Open **Connectors → Targets** and create a new target connector.
    2. Select the destination technology (for example **BigQuery** or **Snowflake**).
    3. Provide write credentials and define the storage location (dataset or schema) Popsink should use.
    4. Test the connection before saving the target.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your pipeline">
    1. Go to a **Target Connector** and click **Ingest Data**.
    2. Select the source data models.
    3. Save and start the pipeline.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate the data flow">
    - Inspect the dashboard to confirm that events are processed and delivered.
    - Check on the target system that tables or collections are updated as expected.
    - Monitor alerts and metrics to maintain long-term performance.
  </Step>

  <Accordion title="Connection verification fails">

    Confirm that the required ports are open and that the supplied credentials have the expected read or write privileges. Compare against the recommended configuration in the connector documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The pipeline stays pending after launch">

    Make sure change data capture is enabled on the source and that quotas or limits on the target side are not exceeded. Review the related alerts to get incident details.
