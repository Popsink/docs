description: Step-by-step guide to creating, configuring, and connecting a self-hosted deployment.
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your infrastructure meets the following requirements:

* **Kubernetes 1.23+**
* **Helm 3.8.0+**
* **Persistent Volume (PV) provisioner** support in the underlying infrastructure

---

## 1. Create a New Deployment

1. Navigate to **Deployments** from the sidebar.
2. Click **New Deployment**.

### Deployment Settings

Fill in the required fields:

* **Deployment name** – Provide a recognizable name for your environment.
* **Deployment URL** – Automatically generated based on your deployment name.
* **Deployment method** – Select **Self-hosted** from the dropdown.

Click **Configure Self-Hosted** to continue.

> 💡 You can request a new region or provider if your preferred option is not listed.

## 2. Configuration

The configuration step bootstraps your deployment on a cluster using the package manager.

> **Note:** No information from this form is permanently stored. It is only used to pre-fill your YAML on the next step. You can skip this step and manually edit the YAML if preferred.

### Optional Setup

You may enable a **PostgreSQL Database** during setup if your deployment requires it.

---

## 3. Retention Strategy

Choose how you want data retention handled:

* **S3 Compatible Storage** – Recommended for scalable object storage.
* **PostgreSQL Database** – Suitable for structured retention needs.

---

## 4. Configure the TLD

Provide the **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)** that will be used to generate values.

> ⚠️ The chart does not manage the ingress configuration. You are responsible for configuring it separately.

Example:

```
demo-popsink.tld
```

Click **Create Chart** when ready.

## 5. Install the Helm Chart

After generating the configuration, follow the provided commands.

### Install the Chart

```bash
helm install release-name oci://ghcr.io/popsink/charts/data-plane --version 0.1.0-alpha.8
```

---

## 6. Review Default Values

A default configuration file is generated for your deployment. It includes:

* Global FQDN
* PostgreSQL enablement flag
* Retention type
* Deployment metadata

Download or copy the configuration and adjust it as needed before applying it to your cluster.

When finished, click **Mark as Complete**.

---

## 7. Await Connection

Once installation is complete, the platform will wait for your self-hosted deployment to connect.

You will see an **"Awaiting connection…"** status until the cluster successfully registers.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If the connection does not establish:

* Verify your Helm installation completed successfully.
* Confirm your ingress and DNS are properly configured.
* Ensure outbound network access is allowed from the cluster.
