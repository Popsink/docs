Connectors in this category funnel continuous event streams into Popsink. They let you attach message buses, brokers, and application producers to our platform.

> Need a refresher on the core concepts? Read the [source connectors overview](./overview) before configuring your first stream.

## Streaming platforms

- [Kafka](./kafka) – Subscribe to your existing Kafka topics through managed consumer groups.
- [Event Hub](./eventhub) – Connect Azure Event Hubs to relay low-latency events.
- [Datagen](./datagen) – Simulate test data to validate pipelines in isolated environments.

## Event ingestion

- [Webhook](./webhook) – Receive inbound HTTP events and trigger Popsink transformations.
