The Salesforce Source Connector integrates with Salesforce, a leading cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. Salesforce offers a comprehensive suite of applications for sales, customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development.

This connector enables real-time extraction and streaming of data from various Salesforce objects, including accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, custom objects, and more. It supports both bulk and incremental data synchronization, allowing for efficient data transfer and up-to-date information flows.

## Prerequisites

### Salesforce Permissions

The connector requires the following permissions in Salesforce:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Object Permissions" icon="table">
    - **View** all objects you want to replicate
    - **Read** access to all fields within those objects
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Permissions" icon="plug">
    - API Enabled permission
    - Access to Salesforce REST API
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="PushTopic Permissions (for real-time CDC)" icon="bell">
    - Create and manage PushTopics
    - Access to Streaming API
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### API Limits

<Note>
Salesforce API limits vary by edition. Ensure your org has sufficient API calls available:
- **Developer Edition:** 15,000 calls/day
- **Professional Edition:** 15,000 calls/day  
- **Enterprise Edition:** 100,000 calls/day
- **Unlimited Edition:** 200,000 calls/day
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Connected App">
    In Salesforce Setup:
    1. Navigate to **App Manager**
    2. Click **New Connected App**
    3. Enable OAuth settings
    4. Set callback URL to Popsink's OAuth endpoint
    5. Add required OAuth scopes:
       - `api` - Access and manage data
       - `refresh_token` - Maintain access
       - `offline_access` - Perform requests on behalf of the user at any time
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Note Credentials">
    After creating the app, save:
    - **Consumer Key** (Client ID)
    - **Consumer Secret** (Client Secret)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize in Popsink">
    Use the OAuth flow in Popsink to authorize access to your Salesforce org.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    Choose which Salesforce objects you want to replicate:
    - Standard objects (Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, etc.)
    - Custom objects from your org
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Sync Settings">

</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**API Usage Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your Salesforce API usage to avoid hitting limits. Use the incremental sync mode to minimize API calls.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Field Selection:** Only replicate fields you actually need. This reduces API payload size and improves sync performance.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**PushTopic Optimization:** For real-time sync, create focused PushTopic queries to reduce unnecessary events.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Bulk API for Initial Loads:** Use Bulk API for large initial data loads (>10,000 records), then switch to incremental sync.
</Tip>
