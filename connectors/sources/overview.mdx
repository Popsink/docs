This section provides a comprehensive guide on Source Connectors, a crucial component of the Popsink platform that enables you to integrate streaming data from various sources into your data infrastructure seamlessly.

## What are Source Connectors?

Source Connectors are modular, reusable components that connect Popsink to various data-producing services, databases, and applications. They are responsible for continuously capturing data changes and streaming those changes to Popsink in real time.

Imagine a Source Connector as a bridge that continuously transports data from a source (such as databases, SaaS applications, or custom APIs) to your Popsink data pipeline, without any manual export or import. It ensures that your data platform reflects the most current state of your data sources.

## How do Source Connectors Work?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Start by configuring a Source Connector with the necessary credentials and permissions to access your data source.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connection">
    Once configured, the Source Connector establishes a connection to the source, often using native APIs provided by the data source.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Capture">
    The Source Connector then listens for changes to the data in real time. This could be new records being added, updates to existing records, or deletions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Streaming">
    As changes are detected, they are streamed to Popsink, where they can be processed, transformed, or moved into Popsink's data storage or another destination of your choice.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Management">
    Through Popsink's user interface, you can monitor the health and performance of your Source Connectors, schedule maintenance windows, and update configurations as needed.
