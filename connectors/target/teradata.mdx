title: Teradata Target
description: Deploying the Teradata target connector to load analytical volumes from Popsink.
---

The Teradata target connector powers your analytical environments by leveraging Teradata's MPP parallelization and optimization features.

## Prerequisites

- **Accounts and roles:** a Teradata user with `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` privileges and access to the TPT utility when used.
- **Infrastructure:** network connectivity between Popsink and the Teradata port (`1025` by default) with TLS encryption enabled; supported versions are Vantage 17.x and later.
- **Capacity and quotas:** sufficient `AMP` allocation to absorb write spikes, session limits sized for Popsink jobs, and appropriately dimensioned permanent/swap space.
- **Monitoring:** access to the `DBC.ResUsage*` views and `DBC.QryLog` to collect performance and error metrics.

## Configuration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Batch loads">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Declare the target">
        Enter the host, system (`DBCName`), and database name in Popsink. Attach a secret containing the service account and, if required, the client certificate.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose the write mode">
        Select the `TPT` utility for large volumes or `FastLoad` for empty tables. Configure the block size (`blocksize`) and `errorlimit` level.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Optimize batches">
        Configure the primary key or secondary indexes, enable multivalue compression, and define the automatic restart policy for failures.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Continuous flows">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable streaming mode">
        Select the `continuous loads` option in Popsink and confirm that the `Teradata Parallel Transporter` component is sized for long-running sessions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Manage latency">
        Tune the `checkpoint_interval` and `commit_frequency` parameters to balance throughput and AMP consumption.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Secure access">
        Restrict the Popsink role to target tables, enable LDAP/Kerberos authentication when available, and log requests through `DBC.DBQLogTbl`.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Monitoring

- Track CPU and I/O usage through `DBC.ResUsageScpu` and `DBC.ResUsageSvpr`, complemented by Popsink metrics (throughput, retries, latency).
- Configure alerts when `2689` (duplicate row) or `2641` (AMP down) errors exceed a defined threshold.
- Retain TPT and FastLoad logs to simplify diagnostics if a job aborts.

## Best practices

- Partition large tables with `PRIMARY INDEX` values aligned to the distribution key.
- Order columns to maximize block-level compression.
- Align Teradata maintenance windows with Popsink schedules to avoid collisions.

<Callout type="warning">
Disable the `CHECKPOINT OFF` option only for exceptional jobs: without a recovery point, restarting a large load can severely impact production.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How should I handle duplicate errors (2689)?">
    Enable the Popsink upsert option or add a staging step with deduplication before the final insert.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if an AMP becomes unavailable?">
    Pause the job, work with the DBA team to restore the AMP, then restart the connector once the cluster state is validated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I audit writes?">
    Use `DBC.QryLog` to trace executed queries and export Popsink logs to your centralized SIEM solution.
