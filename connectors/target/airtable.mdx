title: Airtable Target
description: Configure and operate the Airtable target connector to sync Popsink with your collaborative bases.
---

The Airtable target connector surfaces your Popsink data in Airtable bases while preserving business structure and the platform's real-time collaboration.

## Prerequisites

- **Airtable access:** an account with the "Creator" role on the target workspace plus an API key or PAT token with the `data.records:write` scope.
- **Application parameters:** identify the `baseId`, `tableId`, and target fields, and enable the REST API for the workspace.
- **Platform quotas:** monitor the 50,000-record-per-table limit, 5 requests per second, and the 100 MB maximum attachment size.
- **Governance:** log connector usage in your processing register and validate GDPR compliance for personal data.

## Configuration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scheduled sync">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create the Airtable integration">
        In Popsink, select Airtable as the target and link the PAT token stored in your secrets manager. Verify the token is scoped to the intended workspace.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Map the fields">
        Map each Popsink field to the matching Airtable field. Use column types such as `singleLineText`, `number`, or `date` to stay compatible with the API.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Define the frequency">
        Set the load cadence (cron or interval). Enable stale-record purge to keep bases lightweight.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Near real-time updates">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable webhook mode">
        Configure a Popsink trigger that sends mutations to the Airtable connector immediately after they are received.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Optimize batches">
        Tune `max_records_per_call` and `retry_on_rate_limit` to absorb bursts while respecting API quotas.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Secure credentials">
        Rotate the PAT token every 90 days and restrict its usage with Airtable access controls.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Monitoring

- Analyze the Popsink dashboard to track API response times, the number of records created or updated, and retry attempts.
- Enable alert webhooks when the Airtable API returns `429 Too Many Requests` or `422 Unprocessable Entity`.
- Archive transformation logs to audit changes applied to critical fields.

## Best practices

- Simplify the Airtable views used by Popsink to reduce write latency.
- Document field mappings in a dictionary shared with business teams.
- Automate the removal of obsolete attachments to respect storage limits.

<Callout type="warning">
Do not exceed 10 "Lookup" or "Rollup" columns in automatically fed tables—the API can reject updates if dependencies become cyclical.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I manage record key conflicts?">
    Use the external key column (`recordId`) provided by Popsink. If a conflict occurs, choose the `merge` option to preserve Airtable comments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I write to multiple tables?">
    Yes—create one target per table with dedicated filters and reuse the same PAT token when permissions allow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I track validation errors?">
    Review the Popsink log for details about the rejected request, then replay the call with the Airtable API tester to identify the invalid field.
